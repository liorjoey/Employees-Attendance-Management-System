# Employees Attendance Management System-

a program that maintains employee attendance data for a company or factory and generatea variety of reports upon request.

the program maintaince two files per each department\business name entered- employees list and attendance log
and generate reports based on them:
* All attendance of a certain employee (by entering his\her id number)
* All attendance since the beginning of the month
* All late attendance- attendance that were entered to the system after 9:30 a.m.

Employees can be added in two ways:
1. manually- by entering: first name, last name, id, phone number and selecting date of birth.
2.from another employees file made by the program.
* there are resrictions on the entered data so that only valid characters will be given:
  1.names can consist of letters only
  2.numbers can consist digits only (aka must be possitive).
  3.the id number must be unique: there can't be two employees with the same id on the file.
  4.birth date must be a date that already passed.
  
both options are available for deleting employees: manually (by entering their id) or from file the program as created in the past.

marking attendance is done by entering the employees id (which must be in the employees file)

the system allows you to create files for different department or section of the business.
the data is saved and available for future use.
